Note: These same 3 scripts are in both my JeddoreISDPProject (desktop) folder, and in my JeddoreISDPProjectWeb (web) folder, mainly just for ease of access.

Please run these 3 SQL scripts in the following order:

1. Bullseye_DB2024_1.4.sql (for the main Bullseye DB tables)
2. Bullseye_DB2024_PERMISSIONS.sql (permission tables script)
3. Jeddore_ISDP_DB_Script.sql (script for my own updates to the Bullseye DB)
